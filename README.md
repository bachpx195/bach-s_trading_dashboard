## Chap3: Data Types and Structures

| Object type | Meaning               | Used for                     |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| int         | Integer value         | Natural numbers              |
| float       | Floating-point number | Natural numbers              |
| bool        | Boolean value         | Something true or false      |
| str         | String object         | Character, word, text        |
| tuple       | Immutable container   | Fixed set of objects, record |
| list        | Mutable container     | Changing set of objects      |
| dict        | Mutable container     | Natural numbers              |
| set         | Mutable container     | Collection of unique objects |

## Chap4: Numerical Computing with NumPy

| Object type       | Meaning                    | Used for                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ndarray (regular) | n-dimensional array object | Large arrays of numerical data    |
| ndarray (record)  | 2-dimensional array object | Tabular data organized in columns |

- “Arrays of Data”
  This section is about the handling of arrays of data with pure Python code.

- “Regular NumPy Arrays”
  This is the core section about the regular NumPy ndarray class, the workhorse in almost all data-intensive Python use cases involving numerical data.

- “Structured NumPy Arrays”
  This brief section introduces structured (or record) ndarray objects for the handling of tabular data with columns.

- “Vectorization of Code”
  In this section, vectorization of code is discussed along with its benefits; the section also discusses the importance of memory layout in certain scenarios.

## Chap5: Data Analysis with pandas

This chapter is about pandas, a library for data analysis with a focus on tabular data. pandas is a powerful tool that not only provides many useful classes and functions but also does a great job of wrapping functionality from other packages. The result is a user interface that makes data analysis, and in particular financial analysis, a convenient and efficient task.

| Object type | Meaning                              | Used for                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| DataFrame   | 2-dimensional data object with index | Tabular data organized in columns |
| Series      | 1-dimensional data object with index | Single (time) series of data      |

- “The DataFrame Class”
  This section starts by exploring the basic characteristics and capabilities of the DataFrame class of pandas by using simple and small data sets; it then shows how to transform a NumPy ndarray object into a DataFrame object.

- “The Series Class”
  This rather brief section covers the Series class of pandas, which in a sense represents a special case of the DataFrame class with a single column of data only.

- “GroupBy Operations”
  One of the strengths of the DataFrame class lies in grouping data according to a single or multiple ...
